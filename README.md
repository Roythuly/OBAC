## Overview

Offline-Boosted Actor-Critic (OBAC), a model-free online RL framework that elegantly identifies the outperforming offline policy through value comparison, and uses it as an adaptive constraint to guarantee stronger policy learning performance.

We evaluate our method across **53** diverse continuous control tasks spanning \textbf{6} domains: **Mujoco**, **DMControl**, **Meta-World**, **Adroit**, **Myosuite**, and **Maniskill2**, comparing it with [BAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02865), [TD-MPC2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16828), [SAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290), and [TD3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290).

## Getting started

We provide examples on how to train and evaluate OBAC agent.

### Training

See below examples on how to train OBAC on a single task.

```python
python main.py --env_name YOUR_TASK
```

We recommend using default hyperparameters. See `utilis/default_config.py` for a full list of arguments.

### Evaluation

See below examples on how to evaluate OBAC checkpoints.

```python
python evaluate.py YOUR_TASK_PATH/../checkpoint best
```
